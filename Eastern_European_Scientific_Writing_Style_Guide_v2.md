# Eastern European Scientific Writing Style Guide (Revised)

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for mimicking the writing style commonly found in scientific papers authored by Eastern European researchers, particularly in the fields of physics, engineering, and materials science. This revised version contains only legitimate stylistic choices that do not introduce grammatical errors.

## 1. Vocabulary and Word Choice

### 1.1 Formal Vocabulary Preferences

Prefer longer, more formal word forms:

| Common English | This Style |
|----------------|------------|
| shows | indicates |
| uses | utilizes |
| important | significant |
| main | key |
| different | various |
| about | concerning |
| because | due to the fact that |
| so | as a result |
| also | moreover |
| but | however |
| linked to | connected with |
| despite | in spite of |
| through | via |

### 1.2 Characteristic Adverbs

Use formal adverbs frequently:

- "respectively" at the end of comparative statements
- "especially" for emphasis
- "significantly" instead of "greatly" or "much"
- "efficiently" instead of "well"

**Example:**
"The values for X and Y directions were 5.2 and 3.1, respectively."

### 1.3 Compound Modifiers

Create descriptive chains of modifiers before nouns:

- "uniaxial anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization curve"
- "Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution-based anhysteretic magnetization curve"
- "three-dimensional linear-rotation-saturation (LRS) model"
- "cloud-oriented RESTful API web service"
- "machine-learning-oriented system"

- "From a physical point of view..."
- "From the perspective of..."

### 2.6 Conditional Phrases

- "In such a case..."
- "In this case..."

## 3. Sentence Structure Patterns

### 3.1 Subject-Heavy Openings

Begin sentences with substantial noun phrases before the verb:

**Pattern:** `[Detailed noun phrase subject] + [simple verb] + [object/complement]`

**Examples:**

- "The module **was developed** within..."
- "Calculations **were performed** with OCTAVE software."
- "Data collected from the sensors **are transmitted** to the cloud."

### 3.3 Constructions with "Such"

Use "such" to refer to previously mentioned concepts:

- "**Such** a model of uniaxial anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization was presented previously."
- "**Such** a curve can be measured using a constant magnetic field."
- "**Such** an approach has significant limitations."

### 3.4 Nominalization

Convert verbs to noun forms where possible:

| Verbal Form | Nominalized Form |
|-------------|------------------|
| to identify parameters | identification of parameters |
| to validate the model | validation of the model |
| to implement the system | implementation of the system |
| to optimize the process | optimization of the process |

## 15. Quick Reference: Transformation Example

### Before (Standard Academic English):

"The method we propose greatly improves how efficiently we can identify parameters by reducing unstable parameter sets. Therefore, it is useful for engineering applications even though it is based on necessary but insufficient conditions."

### After (This Style):

"The proposed method significantly increases the efficiency of the parameter identification process through the reduction of unstable parameter sets. As a result, the proposed method is useful for engineering numerical systems, in spite of the fact that the proposed criterion is a necessary but insufficient condition."
